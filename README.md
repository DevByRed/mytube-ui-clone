# 🎬 Mytube

**Mytube** is a YouTube UI clone built entirely using **HTML** and **CSS**, without any frameworks or libraries.  
This project was created by following [SuperSimpleDev's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc), then customized with my own layout, colors, and file structure.

> ⚠️ Front-end only — no video playback, no JavaScript, no backend logic.
